   - **Workflow file or link** (e.g. Zap link, n8n JSON export, or Make.com scenario).  
   - **Brief note** (max 200 words) explaining:  
     - Which tool you chose & why  
     - How you’d handle errors (e.g. duplicate entries)

## Part 3: Simple AI/ML & Data Science Task (90 minutes) - This task is optional but it's a big plus

**Goal:** Build and evaluate a basic machine‑learning model.

1. **Dataset & tools:**  
   - Use the **Iris** dataset from scikit‑learn (or another small public dataset).  
   - Use Python (or any language you prefer).

2. **Steps:**  
   1. **Load & split** the data (80% training / 20% test).  
   2. **Train** a simple model (e.g. Logistic Regression or Decision Tree).  
   3. **Evaluate** by reporting the test accuracy.  
   4. **Insight:** Identify which feature seems most important.

3. **Deliverables:**  
   - **Code file or notebook** containing your solution.  
   - **Short report** (max 150 words) covering:  
     - Which model you chose & why  
     - The test accuracy you achieved  
     - One idea to improve the model

## Submission Instructions

1. Combine **all three parts** into **one** PDF or Markdown file (or a single GitHub repo link - it's prefered to use a GitHub repo but it's not mandatory).  
2. Email it to Engineering Manager **aassou.abdelilah@gmail.com**  
3. Use subject line: **Intern Task – [Your Name]**  
4. Submit at least **48 hours** before your interview.  

We’ll review your work and discuss each part in the interview. 

We don't mind to get some help from GPTs or any other AI tools, but vibe coding is not allowed, you have to understand what you provide.

Good luck—and have fun!
